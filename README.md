# Fatal Heart

A text based adventure game written in C++.

### Story

You play as a no-name adventurer lost in the woods. Nothing to your name, well i guess you don't even have a name worth mentioning.
Your mission is to find yourself, a name to be proud of and a goal for yourself.

### Important

This game runs in a terminal. That means that you need to be sorta careful with a few things. For one. I'd recommend keeping the width of the window either 150 "characters" wide or the entire screen. This is mostly because of art but also, you know, comfort in general and text not being too tight.
Also. Do read the controls, they tell you all commands and actions you'll be able to do so if you're stuck you can always find them here. You can also type "controls" or "help" into the terminal window if you'd rather stay immersed.

### Controls

*General help*:

**help**: Gives you this list of controls. Though probably badly formated. Also gives you a link to my page at the bottom so you can come to github and complain about broken features if there's something I've managed to miss.

**controls**: Just gives you a short list of suggested keywords.

**ENTER(↵)** : Some points in the story pauses to let you read if a lot of text or important details come up. You can then press the ENTER(↵) key to progress.

*Keywords and progression*:

*Keywords are not case sensitive!*: PICKUP and pickup is exactly the same. The game won't notice if you're being sarky or mocking.

I cAnT tElL yOu WhAt To Do


**pickup**: Lets you specify an object to pickup.

**drop**: Lets you specify an object to drop on the ground, down a hole, etc.

**move**: Lets you move to different "*points of interest*" within the "*scene*" you're currently in. You might encounter a clearing with a flowerpatch and a well. You can then type "move well" or "move flowerpatch" to move to that POI. Be careful to write the POI name like the game has written it or it will likely not work as I am too lazy to actually put in aliases for things.

**go**: Lets you move between "*scenes*". You might encounter a place with a road that goes north and a road that goes west. You can then type "go west" or "go north" to move to that scene.
